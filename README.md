# Team-C-API
# Project Description

The original servlet and DAO based Java API was refactored into a "Springified" utilizing spring annotations. 
A UI was also designed by implementing Axios and the React Router Dom patterns. The UI was written in typescript,
CSS, HTML, and React. Users will have the ability to login through the login or new user UI pages,
request new reimbursements on a reimbursement page, and recieve approval from a financial manager.
